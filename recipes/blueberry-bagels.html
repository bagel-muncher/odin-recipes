        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Blueberry bagels are my absolute favorite. I'm a big blueberry fan in general, so 
                I'm probably biased when I say that blueberry bagels are the best type of bagel in the world.
                These bagels are always my "to-go" breakfast option.
            </p>
            <p>Anyways, in light of Panera Bread's decision to discontinue their blueberry bagels, here
                 is an amazing recipe to make <em>amazing</em> blueberry bagels. These bagels will come out as super chewy
                 and rich with sweet blueberry flavor.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 1/4 cups <strong>freeze-dried</strong> blueberries</li>
                <li>1/2 cup + 1 tablespoon lukewarm water</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast or instant yeast</li>
                <li>2 Tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
                <li>3 1/2 cups bread flour (plus extra for dusting)</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li><strong>Poaching</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 liters water</li>
                    <li>1 Tablespoon honey or brown sugar</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Combine water, yeast, and sugar and stir in a large bowl or the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook.
                     If using active dry yeast, let this sit for around 5-10 minutes until it becomes foamy, if using instant yeast this
                      step can be skipped.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add in the flour, salt, blueberries, and vanilla. Use a fork or switch the stand mixer to low speed to combine it into 
                    a thick dough. It should be very thick and slightly sticky. If the dough is too dry, add a tablespoon or two of water as needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Keep it kneading or mixing for around 10 minutes for optimal gluten development.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Form the dough into a ball once it is kneaded and strong. Place the dough ball into a large oiled bowl and cover it with 
                    plastic wrap or a damp towel. Let the dough rise in a warm place until doubled in size.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Deflate the dough and pull it from the bowl onto a lightly floured surface.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Cut the dough into eight equal pieces (a kitchen scale works well to ensure even bagels) and shape each piece into a ball. 
                    Let these dough balls rest for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Use both hands’ thumb and index finger to push a hole into the center of each ball of dough, then roll the dough ball around 
                    your fingers in a circular motion to widen the hole. Aim for a large hole, as it will shrink back in size once it sits.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 8:</strong> Place the shaped bagels on a prepared sheet pan lined with parchment paper and let them puff out a bit for around 30 minutes 
                    while the oven preheats and a pot of water is brought to a boil.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 9:</strong> Bring a large pot of water to a boil and preheat the oven to 425°F/220 °C. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 10:</strong> Once the water is boiling, stir in honey or brown sugar.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 11:</strong> Dust any excess flour off the bagels and drop them in the boiling water one at a time. Boil 2-3 bagels at a time.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 12:</strong> Let them poach in the water for 1 minute total, flipping them after 30 seconds. Remove the bagels from the water using a 
                    slotted spoon. Drain the boiled bagels on a wire rack and continue with the rest of the bagels.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 13:</strong> Place the bagels on the lined baking sheet. Bake them in the oven for 20-25 minutes or until deep golden brown. If they 
                    are baking unevenly or your oven has hot spots, turn the oven tray around after 15 minutes of baking.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 14:</strong> Remove the baked bagels from the tray and let them cool on a cooling rack for 30 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
            </ol>
        <h2>Enjoy!</h2>
